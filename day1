var a=10;     //declaration of dart
int b=19;     //another way of declation in dart
bool isalive=true;
String nm="saitejaswi";
print(a);
print(b);
print(isvalid);
print(nm);
double sai=0.8765;
  print(sai);
    String name="hsgd";
print(name);
String s1='saitejaswi';
print("this is $s1 and the ${nm.length}");
